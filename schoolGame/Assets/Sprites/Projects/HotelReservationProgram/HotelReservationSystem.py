# Airline / Hotel Reservation System - Create a reservation system which books airline
# seats or hotel rooms. It charges various rates for particular sections of the plane or hotel.
# Example, first class is going to cost more than coach. Hotel rooms have penthouse suites which
# cost more. Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.
